        "description": "<b>Nephrotoxicity</b> refers to kidney damage or impaired kidney function caused by exposure to toxic substances, including certain medications. Since the kidneys play a central role in filtering waste products, regulating electrolytes, and maintaining overall fluid balance, any drug-induced kidney injury can significantly affect health. Moreover, as the kidneys are responsible for the excretion of many exogenous toxic compounds, they often are a primary target organ for drugs. Evaluating nephrotoxicity during drug development and treatment is crucial as exposure to pharmaceutical drugs is one of the leading causes of nephrotoxicity. However, the safety assessments on drugs induced nephrotoxicity remains challenging, mainly due a lack of understanding the pathological pathways, lack of suitable non-clinical models and intra- and individual pharmacokinetic differences. In this case study, we tried to improve the safety assessment of two well-known nephrotoxic pharmaceutical compounds, cisplatin and tacrolimus, using a variety of in vitro and in silico tools. "

Recent data indicated that tacrolimus exposure is linked to nephrotoxicity in 20-40% of patients treated with this drug. Managing the risk of nephrotoxicity after tacrolimus use remains difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window. Several cases have been reported of people developing nephrotoxicity even when treated in dose ranges considered to be safe. The molecular mechanisms of tacrolimus induced nephrotoxicity are currently poorly understood, which hampers the risk assessment and limits the use of tacrolimus in the clinic. By employing the process flow methodology, VHP4safety aims to present a solution."

In the VHP4safety project, an AOP was developed to investigate tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity. Tacrolimus exposure has been shown to activate Nf-Kb and NOX, increasing ROS production and oxidative stress which drive mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic impairment, aberrant TGF-B signaling, fibrosis, apoptosis, and ultimately kidney failure. No clear MIE was identified which led to the development of an advanced in vitro platform with multiple models to explore potential MIEs and validate KEs. Mechanistic evidence came from rodent studies, kidney cell lines, and limited clinical data. While the AOP depicted KEs linearly, ROS production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction were interconnected and may occur simultaneously, complicating the identification of a specific initiating event. Overall, this AOP framework links molecular-level effects of tacrolimus to adverse kidney outcomes and guides the selection of relevant experimental models for regulatory assessment."
