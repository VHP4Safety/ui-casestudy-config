        "description": "<b>Nephrotoxicity</b> refers to kidney damage or impaired kidney function caused by exposure to toxic substances, including certain medications. Since the kidneys play a central role in filtering waste products, regulating electrolytes, and maintaining overall fluid balance, any drug-induced kidney injury can significantly affect health. Moreover, as the kidneys are responsible for the excretion of many exogenous toxic compounds, they often are a primary target organ for drugs. Evaluating nephrotoxicity during drug development and treatment is crucial as exposure to pharmaceutical drugs is one of the leading causes of nephrotoxicity. However, the safety assessments on drugs induced nephrotoxicity remains challenging, mainly due a lack of understanding the pathological pathways, lack of suitable non-clinical models and intra- and individual pharmacokinetic differences. In this case study, we tried to improve the safety assessment of two well-known nephrotoxic pharmaceutical compounds, cisplatin and tacrolimus, using a variety of in vitro and in silico tools. "

Recent data indicated that tacrolimus exposure is linked to nephrotoxicity in 20-40% of patients treated with this drug. Managing the risk of nephrotoxicity after tacrolimus use remains difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window. Several cases have been reported of people developing nephrotoxicity even when treated in dose ranges considered to be safe. The molecular mechanisms of tacrolimus induced nephrotoxicity are currently poorly understood, which hampers the risk assessment and limits the use of tacrolimus in the clinic."

Several key biological targets that are associated with tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity. The current AOP suggests that tacrolimus exposure leads to activation of Nf-Kb and NOX, which can lead to increased ROS production and oxidative stress. Increase oxidative stress is associated with increased mitochondrial disfunction eventually resulting in metabolic impairment, aberrant TGF-B, increase in fibrosis and apoptosis in the kidney causing kidney failure. During the AOP development no clear MIE was identified however and therefore an advanced in vitro platform consisting of several relevant models was developed to identify novel molecular initiating events and validate the current AOP key events."

              "description": "Molecular initiating events (MIEs) are chemical interactions with biological targets that trigger cascades leading to adverse outcomes, but the MIE underlying tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity remains unknown. To address this, advanced in vitro kidney models—including iPSC-derived organoids (proximal nephron), ASC-derived tubuloids (distal nephron), and organoid-derived proximal tubule cells—were used to characterize the MIE and downstream key events. Dose–response relationships were determined with LDH assays to establish IC10 and IC50 values for subsequent analyses. In proximal tubule cells, transcriptomics (bulk RNA-seq) indicated CD44 upregulation as a potential MIE, while fluorescence-based assays revealed ROS production, altered intracellular pH, disrupted mitochondrial function, and organelle changes following tacrolimus exposure. Complementary transcriptomics and immunofluorescence in iPSC-derived organoids identified dysregulated pathways, epithelial injury, fibrosis, and senescence, and analyses in ASC-derived tubuloids extended insights to distal nephron toxicity. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPSC organoids with pgp mutations were generated to mimic patient variability, enabling assessment of dose–response relationships under different pgp expression conditions."

              "description": "An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) is a structured framework that links a molecular-level event caused by a stressor (tacrolimus) through a series of measurable biological changes, leading to an adverse outcome at the individual or population level. Developing an AOP aids in the selection of relevant models that address important key events necessary to answer regulatory questions. An AOP for tacrolimus, linking tacrolimus exposure to kidney failure, has been developed by gathering and organizing scientific information from PubMed. Mechanistic evidence for KEs and KERs in this AOP primarily comes from rodent studies, immortalized kidney cell lines and limited clinical evidence. The current AOP suggests that tacrolimus exposure leads to activation of Nf-Kb and NOX, which can lead to increased ROS production and oxidative stress. Increase oxidative stress is associated with increased mitochondrial disfunction eventually resulting in metabolic impairment, aberrant TGF-B, increase in fibrosis and apoptosis in the kidney causing kidney failure. In this AOP, although the sequence of KEs is depicted linearly, we propose that the KEs of ROS production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are fundamentally interconnected and dynamic processes that occur simultaneously. This simultaneity complicates the assessment of whether one event precedes another or if they occur concurrently and made it impossible to identify a specific molecular initiating event."
