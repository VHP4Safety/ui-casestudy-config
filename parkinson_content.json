Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of death in humans and have substantial impact on society, including health care costs and quality of life. Neurodegeneration cannot be adequately tested in animal studies, since the final health outcomes such as cognitive decline and motor function, are difficult to measure in rodents. Little is known on the effect of exposure to chemicals and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disease in humans. For some compounds, including Paraquat, Rotenone and Mancozeb, there are indications of a causal relationship between exposure and neurodegenerative disease. This case study focussed on the putative relationship between pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s Disease, by mapping the critical pathways and mechanisms underlying the disease, as well as the exposure in human biomonitoring studies. Within the case study we created an AOP network for Parkinson’s disease and determined dose-response relationships for several pesticides in relevant in vitro models.</p>"

This step describes the intrinsic potential of a substances (in this case a pesticide) to trigger mechanisms that can lead to development of a disease, in this case Parkinson’s disease.</p><h3>What endpoints (AOPs, adverse outcomes)</h3><p>Clinical symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are dominated by motor dysfunction related to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (substantia nigra). Dopaminergic neurons in general, and the dopaminergic centers in the midbrain in particular, rely on a strict regulation of intracellular calcium levels for their function. Based on this characteristic, an AOP network was designed that revolves around disruption of calcium homeostasis leading to malfunction, and ultimately death of dopaminergic neurons.</p><h3>What compounds (chemical characteristics)</h3><p>Based on key mechanisms included in the AOP, pesticides were selected to be used as model compounds in the in vitro models. Rotenone primarily disrupts mitochondrial function (Complex I inhibition), Dinoseb is known for inducing ER-stress (calcium release) and mitochondrial inhibition, Endosulfan is a known substrate for neurotransmitter receptors leading to overstimulation of neuronal networks, and Mancozeb is known as a source of oxidative stress and disruption of protein homeostasis.  Of these, Dinoseb was chosen as model pesticide to answer question 1. For all pesticides, the impact of exposure on oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death was assessed in various neuronal and non-neuronal cell models.</p><h3>What exposure paradigm (kinetics, chemical characteristics)</h3><p>In contrast to standard exposure paradigms in in vitro systems (24h acute exposure), human real-life exposure is often repeated, or chronic.

These routes are used to calculate aggregate exposure and may also consider cumulative exposure to multiple pesticides with similar mechanisms of action. Special attention can be given to vulnerable groups such as occupationally exposed workers, and children, as their intake relative to body weight or frequency of contact may be higher, increasing potential risk. To answer question 2, occupational- and bystander exposure were considered, taking into account the inhalation and dermal route of exposure, as well as hand-to-mouth contact.</p>"

It is therefore important to determine the relevant brain concentrations of dinoseb. To determine relevant brain concentrations after dinoseb exposure a population based kinetic modelling platform, PhysB, is used. The PhysB model predicts individual organ weights, blood flows and some respiratory parameters from anthopometric properties, such as gender, age, body height and weight. This allows the model to simulate the effects of inter-individual variation on the estimated internal concentration in the brain. In this case, PhysB, has been used to predict internal brain concentrations of dinoseb for workers (men between 18-60 years of age) and bystanders (men and women between 0-80 years old). External exposure assessment data for agriculture workers and bystanders generated from the exposome generator is used as input for the model. The predicted internal brain concentrations of Dinoseb can be used to design in vitro experiments assessing effects of Dinoseb on neurons. In addition, the estimated concentrations can be compared with the concentration-response concentrations that are derived from the in vitro experiments to determine whether the in vitro models are predictive of real-life scenario’s. </p>"

This tool combines existing models, newly developed computational approaches, and curated datasets to generate exposure distributions that can be used in risk assessment and further modeling within the VHP4S framework. The exposome generator draws upon a wide range of input data relevant to different exposure routes. For occupational exposure, essential parameters include pesticide maximum application doses (kg/ha or L/ha), crop type, field size, meteorological conditions (e.g., wind speed, cloud cover), and levels of personal protection (low, medium, high). For dietary exposure, data sources include measured pesticide concentrations in Dutch food items (2011–2020) from the European monitoring program, as well as food consumption statistics across age groups and populations provided in the Raw Primary Commodity (RPC) database. Common environmental and occupational inputs also include information on pesticide use and application methods.</p><p>To transform input data into exposure estimates, a suite of established and custom-built models are applied. The BROWSE model is used to generate occupational exposure distributions, expressed as µg pesticide per kg bodyweight, using standardized application and protection scenarios. For environmental exposure, a Gaussian Plume Drift model implemented in R calculates atmospheric concentrations of pesticides (ng/m³), which are then converted to inhalation and dermal exposure estimates through deposition mechanisms and inhalation rates. For dietary exposure, a Monte Carlo simulation framework in R is applied to estimate daily intake distributions (µg/kg bodyweight) across different food types and consumer populations.</p><p>The modeling is based on a combination of existing models, online datasets, and calculations generated within the VHP4 project. The BROWSE model is a well-established regulatory tool, while the Gaussian Plume and dietary Monte Carlo simulations have been tailored to the VHP4 context. Data on pesticide use (CBS, 2020), consumption (EFSA, 2019), and monitoring of residues (Zenodo repository) are publicly available, with processed datasets accessible on request. The exposome generator produces integrated estimates of external exposure for various pesticides under multiple scenarios.</p><p>Outputs include:</p><ul><li>Occupational exposure levels (µg/kg bw) across protection levels and application practices.</li><li>Environmental exposure values at different distances from treated fields, expressed as µg/kg bw.</li><li>Dietary exposure distributions for different food categories and population subgroups, expressed as µg/kg bw per day.</li></ul><p>Dinoseb was selected as a proof-of-concept substance.

In this case study, an AOP for pesticide exposure leading to Parkinson's disease has been built from literature information and relevant papers using literature search tools such as EMBASE or Medline. The literature was collected in Sysrev, an online service to conduct literature review. Additionally, a machine learning component available in Sysrev was used to predict the inclusion of articles.
