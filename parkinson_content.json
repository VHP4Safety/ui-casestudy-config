        "description": "In this case study we studied life course exposure to pesticides by modelling neurodegeneration (i.e. Parkinson’s disease) in the VHP. Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of death in humans and have substantial impact on society, including health care costs and quality of life. Neurodegeneration cannot be adequately tested in animal studies, since the final health outcomes such as cognitive decline and motor function, are difficult to measure in rodents. Little is known on the effect of exposure to chemicals and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disease in humans. For some compounds, including Paraquat, Rotenone and Mancozeb, there are indications of a causal relationship between exposure and neurodegenerative disease. This case study focussed on the putative relationship between pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s Disease, by mapping the critical pathways and mechanisms underlying the disease, as well as the exposure in human biomonitoring studies. Within the case study we created an AOP network for Parkinson’s disease and determined dose-response relationships for several pesticides in relevant in vitro models."

The exposure assessment for pesticides considers all major routes of human exposure and includes the magnitude and duration of that exposure. A complete exposure assessment takes into account dietary and non-dietary exposure. These routes are used to calculate aggregate exposure and may also consider cumulative exposure to multiple pesticides with similar mechanisms of action. Special attention can be given to vulnerable groups such as occupationally exposed workers, and children, as their intake relative to body weight or frequency of contact may be higher, increasing potential risk. To answer question 2, occupational- and bystander exposure were considered, taking into account the inhalation and dermal route of exposure, as well as hand-to-mouth contact."

It is therefore important to determine the relevant brain concentrations of dinoseb. To determine relevant brain concentrations after dinoseb exposure a population based kinetic modelling platform, PhysB, is used. The PhysB model predicts individual organ weights, blood flows and some respiratory parameters from anthopometric properties, such as gender, age, body height and weight. This allows the model to simulate the effects of inter-individual variation on the estimated internal concentration in the brain. In this case, PhysB, has been used to predict internal brain concentrations of dinoseb for workers (men between 18-60 years of age) and bystanders (men and women between 0-80 years old). External exposure assessment data for agriculture workers and bystanders generated from the exposome generator is used as input for the model. The predicted internal brain concentrations of Dinoseb can be used to design in vitro experiments assessing effects of Dinoseb on neurons. In addition, the estimated concentrations can be compared with the concentration-response concentrations that are derived from the in vitro experiments to determine whether the in vitro models are predictive of real-life scenario’s."

To do this, we need an overview of what are the human relevant biological mechanisms through which pesticides can induce or accelerate development of Parkinson's disease. For this the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept is used, which starts from a molecular initiating event (MIE), proceeds through a number of Key Events (KE) towards the Adverse Outcome (AO). In this case study, an AOP for pesticide exposure leading to Parkinson's disease has been built from literature information and relevant papers using literature search tools such as EMBASE or Medline. The literature was collected in Sysrev, an online service to conduct literature review. Additionally, a machine learning component available in Sysrev was used to predict the inclusion of articles. The AOP developed for this case has been disseminated using the Adverse Outcome Pathway Wiki as <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://aopwiki.org/aops/464\">AOP-464</a>. An overview of the AOP for pesticide exposure leading to Parkinson disease can be found below. This information can be used to determine relevant endpoints in further in vitro experiments."
