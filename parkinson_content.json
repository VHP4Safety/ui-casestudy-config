    "content": "<h2>Case Study Overview</h2><p>In this case study we studied life course exposure to pesticides by modelling neurodegeneration (i.e. Parkinson’s disease) in the VHP. Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of death in humans and have substantial impact on society, including health care costs and quality of life. Neurodegeneration cannot be adequately tested in animal studies, since the final health outcomes such as cognitive decline and motor function, are difficult to measure in rodents. Little is known on the effect of exposure to chemicals and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disease in humans. For some compounds, including Paraquat, Rotenone and Mancozeb, there are indications of a causal relationship between exposure and neurodegenerative disease. This case study focussed on the putative relationship between pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s Disease, by mapping the critical pathways and mechanisms underlying the disease, as well as the exposure in human biomonitoring studies. Within the case study we created an AOP network for Parkinson’s disease and determined dose-response relationships for several pesticides in relevant in vitro models.</p>"

This step describes the intrinsic potential of a substances (in this case a pesticide) to trigger mechanisms that can lead to development of a disease, in this case Parkinson’s disease.</p><h3>What endpoints (AOPs, adverse outcomes)</h3><p>Clinical symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are dominated by motor dysfunction related to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (substantia nigra). Dopaminergic neurons in general, and the dopaminergic centers in the midbrain in particular, rely on a strict regulation of intracellular calcium levels for their function. Based on this characteristic, an AOP network was designed that revolves around disruption of calcium homeostasis leading to malfunction, and ultimately death of dopaminergic neurons.</p><h3>What compounds (chemical characteristics)</h3><p>Based on key mechanisms included in the AOP, pesticides were selected to be used as model compounds in the in vitro models. Rotenone primarily disrupts mitochondrial function (Complex I inhibition), Dinoseb is known for inducing ER-stress (calcium release) and mitochondrial inhibition, Endosulfan is a known substrate for neurotransmitter receptors leading to overstimulation of neuronal networks, and Mancozeb is known as a source of oxidative stress and disruption of protein homeostasis.  Of these, Dinoseb was chosen as model pesticide to answer question 1. For all pesticides, the impact of exposure on oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death was assessed in various neuronal and non-neuronal cell models.</p><h3>What exposure paradigm (kinetics, chemical characteristics)</h3><p>In contrast to standard exposure paradigms in in vitro systems (24h acute exposure), human real-life exposure is often repeated, or chronic. To assess whether the exposure paradigm impacts the outcome in in vitro systems, this case study tested 5 different exposure paradigms ranging from acute, to repeated, and chronic, including the impact of a wash-out period following exposure.</p>"

The exposure assessment for pesticides considers all major routes of human exposure and includes the magnitude and duration of that exposure. A complete exposure assessment takes into account dietary and non-dietary exposure. These routes are used to calculate aggregate exposure and may also consider cumulative exposure to multiple pesticides with similar mechanisms of action. Special attention can be given to vulnerable groups such as occupationally exposed workers, and children, as their intake relative to body weight or frequency of contact may be higher, increasing potential risk. To answer question 2, occupational- and bystander exposure were considered, taking into account the inhalation and dermal route of exposure, as well as hand-to-mouth contact.</p>"
