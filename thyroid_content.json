    "content": "<h2>Case Study Introduction</h2><p>Thyroid hormones (THs), mainly thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are essential regulators of neurological processes and play a crucial role in fetal brain development. Deficiencies in TH levels during critical periods of neurodevelopment have been associated with severe and irreversible neurodevelopmental problems later in life. TH concentrations in the brain are therefore carefully maintained through negative feedback loops and local control mechanisms, including thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters, which regulate cellular influx and efflux; deiodinases, which regulate the activation and inactivation of THs; and thyroid hormone receptors, which bind to TH-responsive elements, thereby regulating the transcription of TH-responsive genes. This complex regulatory system can be disrupted by chemicals that interfere with TH signaling, potentially resulting in severe neurodevelopmental problems.</p><p>Internationally validated and accepted OECD test methods for TH-disrupting chemicals mainly consist of animal studies, which only assess TH system disrupting effects through histopathological changes in the thyroid gland or changes in serum TH levels. However, TH-system disrupting effects are not always reflected in these endpoints and these regulatory test methods currently lack the ability to test for specific molecular mechanisms of TH-system disrupting effects. Moreover, species differences between rodents and humans hamper the evaluation of chemical safety for humans through the use of animal studies.</p><p>The VHP4safety project aims to address these issues by developing a human-based assessment of a known TH-disrupting chemical, silychristin, using a combination of in silico and in vitro methods. Two regulatory questions were posed to determine whether non-animal methods could be used to assess the chemical safety of TH-disrupting chemicals:</p><ol><li>Does silychristin influence the thyroid-mediated brain development in the fetus resulting in cognitive impairment in children?</li><li>What information about a compound do we need to advise women in their pregnancy to decide whether the compound can be used?</li></ol>"

Silymarin is one of the most widely used dietary herbal supplements in the world and is often sold as a hepatoprotective agent or breast-feeding supplement. Various studies have shown that silychristin  is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MCT8, a crucial thyroid hormone ￼transmembrane transporter regulating TH transport into the brain. In humans, a lack of MCT8 has been associated with a severe neurodevelopment disorder known as Allan-Herndon Dudley syndrome. Silychristin is often used a model compound in scientific research to study the effects of MCT8 inhibitions, due to the potency and selectivity towards MCT8. However, despite the widespread use as a supplement no safety evaluations have been conducted for silychristin.</p><p>The current regulatory test methods for TH-system disrupting chemicals most probably cannot properly assess the neurodevelopmental effects of specific MCT8-inhibiting chemicals, such as silychristin. It is known that traditionally used rodent models are less sensitive to the loss of function of MCT8 compared to human patients. Additionally, the lack of brain-specific endpoints in current regulatory test methods further hamper the evaluation of MCT8-inhibition of TH-mediated neurodevelopment. The use of the VHP4Safety platform might circumvent these issues by using a human based approach, through a combination of in silico and in vitro models, to assess the effects of silychristin exposure on TH-mediated brain development in the fetus.</p>"
