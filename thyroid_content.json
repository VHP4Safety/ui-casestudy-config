Deficiencies in TH levels during critical periods of neurodevelopment have been associated with severe and irreversible neurodevelopmental problems later in life. TH concentrations in the brain are therefore carefully maintained through negative feedback loops and local control mechanisms, including thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters, which regulate cellular influx and efflux; deiodinases, which regulate the activation and inactivation of THs; and thyroid hormone receptors, which bind to TH-responsive elements, thereby regulating the transcription of TH-responsive genes. This complex regulatory system can be disrupted by chemicals that interfere with TH signaling, potentially resulting in severe neurodevelopmental problems."

        "description": "Internationally validated and accepted OECD test methods for thyroid hormone system disrupting (THSD) chemicals mainly consist of animal studies, which often only assess THSD effects through histopathological changes in the thyroid gland or changes in serum TH levels. However, THSD effects are not always reflected in these endpoints and these regulatory test methods currently lack the ability to test for specific molecular mechanisms of THSD effects. Moreover, species differences between rodents and humans hamper the evaluation of chemical safety for humans through the use of animal studies."

The aim of the case study was to develop a human based risk assessment for potential THSD chemicals that are difficult to assess using animal models. Two regulatory questions were formulated to demonstrate how the VHP can be used. In research question 1 the vital information for regulatory bodies to advice women in their early pregnancy on the use of silychristin is gathered. Research question 2 aims to develop a safety assessment for silychristin by integrating in silico and in vitro methods developed in the VHP."

          "description": "Silychristin is one of the main constituents of the mixture silymarin, a crude extract obtained from the seeds of Milk Thistle (Silybum Marianum). Silymarin is one of the most widely used dietary herbal supplements in the world and is often sold as a hepatoprotective agent or breast-feeding supplement. Various studies have shown that silychristin  is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MCT8, a crucial thyroid hormone transmembrane transporter regulating TH transport into the brain. In humans, a lack of MCT8 has been associated with a severe neurodevelopment disorder known as Allan-Herndon Dudley syndrome. Silychristin is often used a model compound in scientific research to study the effects of MCT8 inhibitions, due to the potency and selectivity towards MCT8. However, despite the widespread use as a supplement no safety evaluations have been conducted for silychristin. "

The current regulatory test methods for TH-system disrupting chemicals therefore cannot properly assess the neurodevelopmental effects of specific MCT8-inhibiting chemicals, such as silychristin. Additionally, the lack of brain-specific endpoints in current regulatory test methods further hamper the evaluation of MCT8-inhibition of TH-mediated neurodevelopment. The use of the VHP4Safety platform might circumvent these issues by using a human based assessment, through the integration of in silico and in vitro models, to assess the effects of silychristin exposure on TH-mediated brain development in the fetus. The scope of this case study was mainly on the direct acute effects of silychristin on neurodevelopment in the fetus. Therefore, the influence of maternally derived TH perturbations are not yet taken into account for the risk assessment. "

Therefore, the influence of maternally derived TH perturbations are not yet taken into account for the risk assessment. We first derived a realistic exposure scenario for silychristin and subsequently used modelling approaches to determine how silychristin reaches the fetal brain. Then a combination of in silico and in vitro models were employed to assess the potential hazard of silychristin. The modelled fetal brain concentrations were then used as input in a quantitative AOP to assess whether a realistic exposure could trigger neurodevelopmental effects. "

Most product information of gathered silymarin supplements only report on the amount of silymarin itself and not on silychristin. In order to derive estimated intake of silycrhistin it was therefore necessary to calculate the amount of silychristin in silymarin mixtures. Therefore, a literature search was conducted using <b>Sysrev</b> to gather publications that analytically measured contents of commercially available silymarin capsules. The literature search included various combinations of the following search terms: “Silymarin”, “capsules”, “contents”, “constituents”, “active components”, “flavonolignan”, “mixture analysis”. The selection criteria of literature were based on relevance to the scientific questions and quality selection was done based on expert judgement. Silychristin contents in silymarin mixtures varied between sources, but could be categorized in three orders: low silychristin contents (~6% of total silymarin), moderate silychristin contents (~12% of total silymarin) and high silychristin contents (~23% of total silymarin)."

For the recommended daily dose silymarin from product leaflets on the dutch market, this constitutes to an RDI of 0.23 – 6.2 mg/kg bw per day. For the recommended daily dose silymarin from product leaflets in the NIH dietary supplement database, this constitutes to an RDI of 0.12 – 13.2 mg/kg bw per day.
